# What is a Knutt?

Knutt is the German name for a bird called the [red knot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_knot). 

Knutt is also family of workflow pipelines providing assembly, annotation, binning and phylogenetic analysis for metagenome studies based on short-read whole genome shotgun sequencing. 

Every Knutt pipeline is designed to provide you with an easy to use Snakemake workflow with integrated data reporting.
